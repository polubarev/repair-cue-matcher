## Method Note

- **Data structure:** We use an Aho–Corasick automaton built over the normalized repair-cue phrases. The automaton is represented as a trie whose nodes store outgoing character transitions, a failure link, and a list of pattern IDs that end at that node.
- **Text normalization:** Before both construction and matching, phrases are normalized with NFC, case-folding, accent stripping (via NFD + removal of combining marks), light punctuation canonicalization (curly quotes → ASCII), and whitespace collapsing. This makes matching robust across English/Spanish variations (e.g., “entendí” ≈ “entendi”).
- **Time complexity:** Building the automaton is linear in the total length of all cue patterns. For each agent turn, the matching algorithm processes each character exactly once plus a bounded number of failure transitions, and emits matches as they occur, giving per-turn runtime **O(L + M)**, where L is the length of the normalized turn and M is the number of matches.
- **Independence from k:** After construction, the automaton always follows at most one forward edge and a constant-amortized number of failure links per character, so the per-turn runtime does not scale linearly with the number of cues k. Adding more patterns increases the size of the automaton but not the asymptotic per-turn matching cost.
- **Memory complexity:** Memory usage is **O(S)**, where S is the total number of trie states plus stored transitions and outputs. This grows roughly linearly with the total character length of all cue phrases (including synthetic variants used to reach larger k for benchmarking).
- **Assumptions:** For k = 10, 50, 200 (or higher), we start from a human-authored cue list (≥ 40 cues) and, if needed, generate systematic variants (e.g., adding “please”, “one more time”, Spanish “por favor”) to reach the desired k; this stresses performance without requiring hundreds of manually written cues. Benchmarks report **milliseconds per turn** (ms/turn) over **agent turns that immediately follow patient turns**, matching the “fire only after patient turn” integration rule. Matching is done on the normalized character stream without enforcing strict word boundaries; in practice, cues are multi-word phrases, so substring matches align with natural word boundaries in the transcripts.
